## Parameters

---
#### balancermember_active (array)
Provide a list of active balancemembers to be added to the catalog. Takes the same key names provided via $balancermember.
If specified, it acts like a filter that removes all $balancermember not listed here.

Using this parameter you can deactivate balance members without needing to manipulate $balancemember.
This enables you to use a global list for $balancemember and decide specificly which members are available.
Also you can use $balancermember_active to easily disable members temporarily only.

If not specified (the default), $balancemember will not be modified.

- *Default*: undef

## Limitations

This module should have the same limitations as puppetlabs/puppetlabs-haproxy
this is just a wrapper.

## Development
